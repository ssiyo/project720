</details>

<details>
<summary>Neuroplasticity</summary>

- The brain's ability to reorganize and adapt by forming new neural connections throughout life.

- Leveraging neuroplasticity can manipulate individuals by inducing changes in their brain structure or function to influence behavior or decision-making processes.

- Harnessing neuroplasticity can guide manipulation efforts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Immediate Gratification vs. Delayed Gratification</summary>

- The conflict between choosing smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards.

- Exploiting immediate gratification vs. delayed gratification can manipulate individuals by framing choices in a way that emphasizes short-term gains or long-term benefits to influence their decisions or actions.

- Shaping gratification preferences can guide manipulation strategies.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Emotion Regulation</summary>

- The ability to manage and control one's emotions, often associated with the prefrontal cortex.

- Leveraging emotion regulation can manipulate individuals by inducing emotional states that impair their decision-making or reasoning abilities, making them more susceptible to manipulation.

- Disrupting emotion regulation can guide manipulation efforts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Mirror Neurons</summary>

- Neurons that fire both when an individual performs an action and when they see someone else perform that same action.
