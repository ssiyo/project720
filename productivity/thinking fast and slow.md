# Thinking Fast and Slow
<details>

<summary>Dual Process Theory</summary>

- The brain uses two thinking systems: System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (deliberative).

- System 1 operates automatically and quickly, while System 2 is slower and more analytical.

- Understanding these systems helps explain thinking processes.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Heuristics</summary>

- Mental shortcuts that simplify decision-making.

- Heuristics can lead to cognitive biases and errors in judgment.

- Heuristics are efficient but not always accurate.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Cognitive Biases</summary>

- Systematic patterns of deviation from rationality in judgment.

- Cognitive biases often lead to irrational decision-making.

- Examples include confirmation bias and availability heuristic.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Anchoring Effect</summary>

- The tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions.

- Initial information (the anchor) influences subsequent judgments.

- Anchoring can lead to biased decisions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Loss Aversion</summary>

- The tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains.

- Loss aversion can lead to irrational risk-averse behavior.

- It plays a role in decision-making under uncertainty.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Prospect Theory</summary>

- A model for understanding how people make choices under risk and uncertainty.

- It explains deviations from rational choice theory, such as risk aversion and the framing effect.

- Prospect theory is a key concept in behavioral economics.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Framing Effect</summary>

- The way information is presented (framed) can influence decision-making.

- People react differently to the same information depending on how it is presented.

- Framing can lead to biased judgments.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Availability Heuristic</summary>

- The tendency to overestimate the importance of information that is readily available.

- Recent, vivid, or memorable events are given more weight in decision-making.

- Availability can lead to biases in risk assessment.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Regression to the Mean</summary>

- The phenomenon where exceptional or extreme outcomes tend to move closer to the average over time.

- Understanding regression to the mean is important in interpreting data and making predictions.

- It can lead to misinterpretation of patterns.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Overconfidence Bias</summary>

- The tendency to overestimate one's own abilities or the accuracy of one's beliefs.

- Overconfidence can lead to poor decision-making and excessive risk-taking.

- It's a common cognitive bias.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Endowment Effect</summary>

- People tend to value items they own more than equivalent items they do not own.

- The endowment effect can lead to suboptimal decisions in trading and negotiation.

- It's a psychological bias in economics and behavioral science.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Systematic Decision Errors</summary>

- Predictable errors in decision-making that stem from cognitive biases.

- Examples include confirmation bias, anchoring, and availability heuristic.

- Awareness of these errors can improve decision quality.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Thinking Slow</summary>

- Engaging in slow, deliberate, and analytical thinking (System 2).

- Thinking slow is valuable for complex decision-making and problem-solving.

- It involves careful consideration and conscious effort.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Thinking Fast</summary>

- Quick, intuitive, and automatic thinking (System 1).

- Thinking fast is useful for everyday decisions but can lead to cognitive biases.

- It's a fundamental aspect of human cognition.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Prospective Hindsight</summary>

- Imagining that you knew the outcome of an event before it occurred.

- Prospective hindsight can lead to a false sense of foreseeability.

- It's related to the hindsight bias.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Hindsight Bias</summary>

- The tendency to see events as having been predictable after they have already occurred.

- Hindsight bias can lead to overconfidence in our judgment of past events.

- It affects how we evaluate decision-makers.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Utility Theory</summary>

- A model for measuring and maximizing utility (satisfaction or well-being) in decision-making.

- Utility theory is used in economics and psychology to understand preferences.

- It underlies many decision-making models.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Behavioral Economics</summary>

- A field that combines insights from psychology and economics to study human decision-making.

- Behavioral economics explores how cognitive biases influence economic choices.

- It has practical applications in policy and marketing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Regression Fallacy</summary>

- Mistakenly attributing the regression to the mean to a causal factor.

- The regression fallacy can lead to incorrect conclusions about cause and effect.

- It's important in analyzing data and making inferences.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Planning Fallacy</summary>

- The tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions and overestimate the benefits.

- The planning fallacy can lead to overly optimistic project estimates.

- It's a common cognitive bias.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Confirmation Bias</summary>

- The tendency to seek and interpret information that confirms one's preconceptions.

- Confirmation bias can lead to the disregard of conflicting evidence.

- It's a prevalent cognitive bias.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Two-System Interaction</summary>

- System 1 and System 2 interact in decision-making.

- System 1 often generates intuitions, which System 2 can accept, modify, or reject.

- Understanding their interaction is key to rational thinking.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Availability Cascade</summary>

- A self-reinforcing process where public opinion is influenced by the repetition of a particular belief or story.

- Availability cascades can lead to widespread beliefs based on limited information.

- It's relevant in the spread of misinformation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Cognitive Ease</summary>

- The state of mind when information processing is effortless and comfortable.

- Cognitive ease can lead to reliance on heuristics and biases.

- It influences how information is processed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Expert Intuition</summary>

- The intuitive judgments of experts based on their extensive experience.

- Expert intuition is often accurate and relies on pattern recognition.

- It's a valuable aspect of decision-making.
