</details>

<details>

<summary>Database Management System (DBMS)</summary>

- A DBMS is software for managing databases.

- It includes tools for creating, modifying, and querying databases.

- Popular DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Oracle.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Authentication</summary>

- Authentication verifies user identities before granting access to a system or application.

- It involves username-password validation, multi-factor authentication, and OAuth.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Authorization</summary>

- Authorization controls what actions users can perform based on their roles and permissions.

- It specifies who can access certain resources or perform specific operations.

- Enhances security and data protection.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Server Frameworks</summary>

- They include libraries and tools for building web applications efficiently.

- Streamline development and maintainability.

</details>

<details>

<summary>RESTful API</summary>

- A RESTful API follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST).

- It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for data manipulation.

- Enables stateless and scalable web services.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Middleware</summary>

- Middleware is software that sits between the web server and the application logic.

- It handles tasks like authentication, request parsing, and logging.

- Enhances application functionality and security.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Session Management</summary>

- Session management maintains user data across multiple requests.

- It tracks user interactions and stores data like login status and shopping carts.

- Critical for maintaining user state.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Caching</summary>

- Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval.

- It reduces server load and improves response times.

- Common caching methods include CDN caching and in-memory caching.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Load Balancing</summary>

- Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.

- It improves application reliability and handles increased user loads.

- Ensures high availability and performance.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Server Security</summary>

- Server security involves protecting servers from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.

- Measures include firewalls, regular updates, and intrusion detection systems.

- Critical for data protection and system integrity.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Serverless Computing</summary>

- Serverless computing allows developers to run code without managing servers.

- It abstracts server infrastructure, focusing on writing and deploying code.

- Simplifies scalability and reduces maintenance.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Scalability</summary>

- Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increased load and demand.

- It can be achieved through vertical scaling (adding resources) or horizontal scaling (adding more servers).

- Ensures performance under heavy traffic.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Database Migration</summary>

- Database migration involves changing the structure or data of a database without data loss.

- It's essential when evolving applications and schemas.

- Supports version control and updates.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Error Handling</summary>

- Error handling is managing unexpected issues that may occur in server-side code.

- It involves logging errors, providing meaningful error messages, and gracefully handling failures.

- Improves application reliability and user experience.

</details>

<details>
