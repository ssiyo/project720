</details>

<details>

<summary>API (Application Programming Interface)</summary>

- APIs are interfaces that allow different software components to communicate and interact.

- They enable microservices to work together and access cloud services.

- Critical for building modular and interconnected apps.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Scalability</summary>

- Scalability is the ability to handle increased workload or user demand.

- Cloud-native apps can scale horizontally (adding more instances) or vertically (adding more resources).

- Ensures performance under varying loads.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Fault Tolerance</summary>

- Fault tolerance ensures an app can continue functioning despite failures or errors.

- It includes redundancy, failover, and self-healing mechanisms.

- Enhances system reliability.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Auto Scaling</summary>

- Auto scaling automatically adjusts resources based on traffic and usage patterns.

- It minimizes over-provisioning and reduces costs during low-demand periods.

- Optimizes resource utilization.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Immutable Infrastructure</summary>

- Immutable infrastructure means that once deployed, servers or containers are never modified.

- Changes are made by replacing old instances with updated ones.

- Improves consistency and reliability.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Cloud-Native Security</summary>

- Cloud-native security focuses on protecting applications and data in cloud environments.

- It includes identity management, encryption, and access control.

- Critical for data privacy and compliance.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Monitoring and Observability</summary>

- Monitoring tracks the performance and health of cloud-native apps.

- Observability goes beyond monitoring to understand system behavior and performance.

- Supports troubleshooting and optimization.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Load Balancing</summary>

- Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers or instances.

- It improves app availability, fault tolerance, and performance.

- Ensures even distribution of workloads.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Service Mesh</summary>

- A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication.

- It provides security, load balancing, and traffic management for microservices.

- Enhances visibility and control.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</summary>

- IaC is the practice of defining and managing infrastructure using code and automation tools.

- It allows reproducible and version-controlled infrastructure.

- Streamlines provisioning and configuration.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Cloud-Native Storage</summary>

- Cloud-native storage solutions are designed for dynamic, scalable, and distributed data storage in the cloud.

- They include object storage, block storage, and file storage options.

- Supports data resilience and flexibility.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Event-Driven Architecture</summary>

- Event-driven architecture involves components that communicate through events or messages.

- It enables decoupled and asynchronous communication between microservices.

- Facilitates real-time processing and scalability.

</details>

<details>

<summary>GitOps</summary>

- GitOps is a DevOps practice that uses Git repositories as the source of truth for infrastructure and application configuration.

- Changes in Git trigger automated updates to the cloud infrastructure.

- Enhances consistency and automation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Infrastructure Orchestration</summary>

- Infrastructure orchestration automates the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure resources.
