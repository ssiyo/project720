</details>

<details>

<summary>MVC (Model-View-Controller)</summary>

- MVC is a design pattern that separates an app into Model (data), View (presentation), and Controller (logic) components.

- It enhances code organization and reusability.

- Common in web and mobile app development.

</details>

<details>

<summary>MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)</summary>

- MVVM is a design pattern that separates an app into Model (data), View (presentation), and ViewModel (logic) components.

- It's used for clean data binding and UI updates.

- Common in modern mobile app development.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Clean Architecture</summary>

- Clean architecture emphasizes separation of concerns by organizing code into layers with clear dependencies.

- It makes apps more maintainable, testable, and adaptable.

- Favored for large and long-lived projects.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Serverless Architecture</summary>

- Serverless architecture relies on cloud services to handle backend logic, eliminating the need for server management.

- It scales automatically and reduces infrastructure costs.

- Ideal for event-driven and scalable apps.

</details>

<details>

<summary>RESTful API</summary>

- A RESTful API follows principles for designing networked applications, using HTTP methods for operations like GET, POST, and DELETE.

- It provides a simple and standardized way to access and manipulate resources.

- Common for mobile app backend services.

</details>

<details>

<summary>GraphQL</summary>

- GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.

- It reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data, improving app performance.

- Flexible for mobile apps with varying data requirements.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Offline-First Architecture</summary>

- Offline-first architecture ensures app functionality even when a device is not connected to the internet.

- It stores data locally and syncs with a backend when online.

- Critical for apps with intermittent connectivity.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Native App</summary>

- A native app is developed for a specific platform (e.g., iOS or Android) using platform-specific languages and tools.

- It provides optimal performance and access to device features.

- Common for app stores.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Cross-Platform App</summary>

- A cross-platform app is developed using a single codebase and can run on multiple platforms (e.g., React Native, Flutter).

- It reduces development time and costs but may sacrifice some platform-specific features.

- Efficient for targeting multiple platforms.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Hybrid App</summary>

- A hybrid app combines web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) within a native container.

- It offers a balance between web and native app capabilities.

- Useful for simple apps with cross-platform needs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Progressive Web App (PWA)</summary>

- A PWA is a web app that provides a native app-like experience, including offline functionality.

- It's accessible via a browser and can be installed on a user's home screen.

- Enhances mobile web app performance.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Containerization</summary>

- Containerization packages app components and dependencies into containers for consistent and portable deployment.

- It ensures apps run consistently across different environments.

- Useful for app scalability and DevOps.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Firebase</summary>

- Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform with various services like hosting, authentication, and real-time database.

- It simplifies backend development and app analytics.

- Favored for rapid prototyping and small projects.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Material Design</summary>

- Material Design is a design language by Google that provides guidelines for consistent and visually appealing mobile app UIs.

- It emphasizes material surfaces, animations, and typography.

- Enhances user interface design.

</details>

<details>

<summary>App State Management</summary>

- App state management manages the state and data flow within an app, ensuring data consistency and UI updates.

- It's essential for complex apps with dynamic content.

- Common in modern mobile app development.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Push Notifications</summary>

- Push notifications are messages sent to a user's device to inform or engage them.

- They enhance user engagement and retention.

- Critical for real-time updates and communication in apps.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Dependency Injection</summary>

- Dependency injection provides components with their dependencies, making it easier to test and replace components.

- It enhances code modularity, testability, and flexibility.

- Common in app architectures.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Singleton Pattern</summary>

- The singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance.

- It ensures a single point of access to that instance.

- Used for managing shared resources in an app.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Reactive Programming</summary>

- Reactive programming uses observables and streams to handle asynchronous and event-driven tasks.

- It simplifies complex async operations and UI updates.

- Common in mobile app development with dynamic data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS)</summary>

- MBaaS provides cloud-based backend services (e.g., databases, authentication) for mobile apps.

- It accelerates app development and reduces backend management.

- Useful for startups and small teams.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</summary>

- SSR renders web pages on the server before sending them to the client's device.

- It improves page load times and SEO by providing pre-rendered content.
