<summary>Component</summary>

- Components are building blocks of a React application.

- They encapsulate UI and behavior for reusability.

- Each component can be thought of as a part of the user interface.

</details>

<details>

<summary>State</summary>

- State is data that a component can maintain and modify.

- It allows components to remember and respond to changes.

- Used for managing dynamic content.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Props</summary>

- Props (short for properties) are inputs that a component receives.

- They allow passing data from parent to child components.

- Props are read-only and help make components reusable.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Virtual DOM</summary>

- The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM.

- It helps optimize rendering and improve performance.

- React uses it to efficiently update the user interface.

</details>

<details>

<summary>JSX</summary>

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React.

- It allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript files.

- Helps create React elements in a more readable way.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Render</summary>

- Rendering means displaying components on the web page.

- React components render to the Virtual DOM before updating the actual DOM.

- Render methods return what should be displayed.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Component Lifecycle</summary>

- The component lifecycle represents stages in a component's existence.

- It includes mounting, updating, and unmounting phases.

- Developers can hook into these phases to run code.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Event Handling</summary>

- Event handling in React involves responding to user interactions.

- Developers use event handlers to execute functions in response to events like clicks.

- Enables interactivity in web applications.

</details>

<details>

<summary>State Management</summary>

- State management is the process of managing data within a React application.

- It ensures that components share and update data as needed.

- Libraries like Redux and Mobx help with state management.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Conditional Rendering</summary>

- Conditional rendering is showing or hiding elements based on conditions.

- It's achieved by using conditional statements like if or ternary operators.

- Helps create dynamic and responsive UIs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Component Props Validation</summary>

- Props validation is a way to specify the expected data type for props.

- It helps catch potential errors early in development.

- Improves component reliability.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Hooks</summary>

- Hooks are functions that allow functional components to manage state and lifecycle features.

- Introduced in React 16.8 to enable state in functional components.

- Reduce the need for class components.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Router (React Router)</summary>

- React Router is a library for adding routing to React applications.

- It enables navigation between different views or pages within a single-page application.

- Helps create complex, multi-page apps.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Redux</summary>

- Redux is a state management library for React applications.

- It provides a global store to manage application state.

- Redux simplifies data sharing between components.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Context API</summary>

- Context API is a feature for passing data through the component tree.

- It avoids prop drilling by providing a central data store accessible to nested components.

- Simplifies state sharing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Component Styling</summary>

- Component styling is the process of applying styles to React components.

- Various methods like CSS, CSS-in-JS, and libraries like styled-components are used.

- Enhances component appearance.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Fragment</summary>

- A Fragment is a built-in component in React used to group elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

- It helps avoid unnecessary divs or wrappers in the component tree.

- Improves code cleanliness.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Key Prop</summary>

- The key prop is used to give elements in an array a stable identity.

- It helps React efficiently update and re-render lists.

- Prevents rendering issues in dynamic lists.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Higher-Order Components (HOCs)</summary>

- HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component.

- They enhance or modify the behavior of the original component.

- Used for code reuse and logic sharing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>React DevTools</summary>

- React DevTools is a browser extension for inspecting and debugging React applications.

- It provides a graphical interface to examine component hierarchies and state.

- Helps identify and fix issues.

</details>

<details>

<summary>PropTypes</summary>

- PropTypes are a way to specify the expected data types of props in a component.

- They provide runtime checks for prop types in development mode.

- Improves code quality and robustness.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Error Boundaries</summary>

- Error boundaries are components used to handle errors in a part of the component tree.

- They prevent the entire app from crashing due to errors in a single component.

- Enhances app stability.

</details>

<details>

<summary>React Fragments</summary>

- React Fragments are a shorthand syntax for defining fragments.

- Introduced in React 16 to simplify the use of Fragments.

- Maintains clean component structures.
