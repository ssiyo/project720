</details>

<details>

<summary>Stress Testing</summary>

- Stress Testing assesses the software's stability under extreme conditions, like high traffic or resource limitations.

- It determines the software's breaking points and failure behavior.

- Identifies potential weaknesses.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Smoke Testing</summary>

- Smoke Testing is a preliminary test to check if the software build is stable and ready for further testing.

- It verifies basic functionality before extensive testing.

- Ensures testing resources are used efficiently.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Exploratory Testing</summary>

- Exploratory Testing involves testers exploring the software without predefined test cases.

- It's intuitive and aims to uncover unexpected issues.

- Useful for early defect discovery.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Boundary Testing</summary>

- Boundary Testing assesses how the software behaves at the limits of input ranges.

- It checks if the software handles boundary conditions correctly.

- Critical for data validation and robustness.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Alpha Testing</summary>

- Alpha Testing is internal testing conducted by the software development team.

- It identifies issues and bugs before releasing to a wider audience.

- Ensures software readiness for beta testing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Beta Testing</summary>

- Beta Testing involves external users testing the software in a real-world environment.

- It collects feedback and identifies usability issues.

- Prepares the software for the final release.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Code Coverage</summary>

- Code Coverage measures the percentage of code lines executed during testing.

- It indicates how thoroughly the code has been tested.

- Used to assess test completeness.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Test Case</summary>

- A Test Case is a set of conditions or steps used to perform a specific test on the software.

- It defines inputs, expected results, and execution steps.

- Essential for systematic testing.

</details>
