<details>

<summary>UML (Unified Modeling Language)</summary>

- UML is a standardized visual language for modeling software systems.

- It uses diagrams and symbols to represent system structure and behavior.

- Facilitates communication and design in software development.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Use Case Diagram</summary>

- A use case diagram in UML shows how users interact with a system.

- It outlines different scenarios (use cases) and their relationships.

- Helps define system functionality from a user's perspective.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Class Diagram</summary>

- A class diagram in UML depicts the structure of a system by representing classes and their relationships.

- It shows attributes, methods, and associations between classes.

- Useful for designing and understanding system architecture.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Activity Diagram</summary>

- An activity diagram in UML visualizes workflows or processes within a system.

- It uses actions, decisions, and control flow to represent activities.

- Helps model complex business processes.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Sequence Diagram</summary>

- A sequence diagram in UML displays interactions between objects over time.

- It shows the order of messages exchanged and lifelines of objects.

- Used for modeling dynamic behavior in system interactions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>State Diagram</summary>

- A state diagram in UML represents the states and transitions of an object or system.

- It shows how objects change state in response to events.

- Useful for modeling state-dependent behavior.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Component Diagram</summary>

- A component diagram in UML illustrates the components and interfaces of a system.

- It shows how components interact and can be used for system architecture.

- Helps visualize system composition.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Deployment Diagram</summary>

- A deployment diagram in UML depicts the physical deployment of components on hardware.

- It shows nodes, devices, and their connections.

- Used to plan system deployment.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Object Diagram</summary>

- An object diagram in UML represents instances of classes at a specific point in time.

- It shows objects and their relationships.

- Useful for testing and debugging.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Package Diagram</summary>

- A package diagram in UML organizes elements into packages or namespaces.

- It shows the structure and dependencies between packages.

- Helps manage and structure complex systems.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Association</summary>

- An association in UML represents a relationship between two or more classes.

- It defines how objects of one class are related to objects of another.

- Used to model connections between elements.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Inheritance</summary>

- Inheritance in UML represents a relationship where one class inherits attributes and behaviors from another.

- "It supports code reuse and the "is-a" relationship."

- Useful for creating hierarchies of classes.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Aggregation</summary>

- "Aggregation in UML represents a "whole-part" relationship between classes."

- It shows that one class contains or is composed of other classes.

- Useful for modeling complex structures.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Composition</summary>

- Composition in UML is a stronger form of aggregation where one class is composed of other classes.

- "It implies a "lifecycle" dependency between the whole and its parts."

- Used for modeling strong relationships.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Multiplicity</summary>

- Multiplicity in UML specifies the number of instances that participate in a relationship.

- It defines the cardinality or how many objects can be related.

- Ensures accurate modeling of relationships.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Generalization</summary>

- Generalization in UML represents the inheritance of attributes and behaviors from a general class to a specific class.

- "It supports the "is-a" relationship and code reuse."

- Useful for creating class hierarchies.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Stereotype</summary>

- A stereotype in UML adds custom metadata or properties to model elements.

- It extends the UML language for specific modeling needs.

- Enhances the expressiveness of UML.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Actor</summary>

- An actor in UML represents an external entity or user interacting with a system.

- It defines roles and responsibilities of external elements.

- Used in use case diagrams to represent system users.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Association Class</summary>

- An association class in UML represents a class that is part of an association.

- It adds attributes and behaviors to associations.

- Useful for modeling additional information about relationships.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Namespace</summary>

- A namespace in UML is a container that organizes model elements.

- It prevents naming conflicts and provides structure.

- Supports modular and organized modeling.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Use Case</summary>

- A use case in UML represents a specific interaction or functionality provided by a system.

- It defines a set of actions and scenarios.

- Used for capturing system requirements.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Multiplicity Range</summary>

- Multiplicity range in UML defines the valid number of instances allowed in a relationship.

- It sets constraints on how many objects can participate.

- Ensures precise modeling of relationships.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Collaboration Diagram</summary>

- A collaboration diagram in UML shows how objects collaborate to achieve a goal.

- It emphasizes the interaction and communication between objects.

- Useful for dynamic system modeling.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)</summary>

- OOAD is a methodology that uses UML to model and design software systems.

- It emphasizes object-oriented principles for system development.

- Supports structured and efficient software design.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Component-Based Development</summary>

- Component-based development in UML uses components as modular building blocks.

- It promotes reusability and flexibility in system design.

- Streamlines software development and maintenance.
